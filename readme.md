# Cosmic Earth - Terrain Generator
### *A second and reimagined release of the original Cosmic Earth Terrain Generator that never had a release to begin with*

---
This terrain generator aims to both provide **stylized landscapes** using complex noise functions and to give an extensible interface for others to create **new terrain** with as well.

This is a mod for [Cosmic Reach](https://finalforeach.itch.io/cosmic-reach), a game by [FinalForEach](https://www.youtube.com/@finalforeach) (YouTube link), built using the [Puzzle Modloader](https://github.com/PuzzleLoader/).
